enjoying

time
with
plenty
of
merriment
they
build
a
snowman
who
elsa
names
olaf
that
likes
warm
hugs
when
elsa
however
hits
anna
with
her
powers
in
an
attempt
to
save
her
little
sister
from
falling
the
royal
family
journeys
to
the
legendary
valley
of
the
living
rock
to
seek
the
help
of
trolls
who
remove
the
magic
from
anna
along
with
her
memory
of
her
sister's
magic
ability
elsa
is
then
ostracized
from
everyone
including
anna
in
order
to
protect
her
from
the
world
until
she
can
learn
to
control
her
powers
leaving
both
sisters
distraught
and
lonely
their
despair
only
escalates
when
their
parents
die
10
years
later
after
they
go
on
a
ship
to
sail
somewhere
when
a
storm
erupts
with
a
wave
capsizing
the
ship
three
years
later
it
is
the
day
of
elsa's
idina
menzel
coronation
ceremony
dignitaries
from
around
the
world
are
coming
to
visit
including
the
duke
of
weselton
alan
tudyk
who
wants
to
run
arendelle's
profits
dry
nobody
is
more
excited
than
anna
kristen
bell
as
they
are
finally
opening
the
gates
to
the
kingdom
she
is
happy
to
see
other
people
and
hopes
for
the
possibility
of
meeting
that
special
someone
but
elsa
is
still
concerned
about
trying
to
control
her
powers
for
the
first
time
in
forever
as
she
strolls
out
onto
the
streets
she
bumps
into
a
horse
who
happens
to
belong
to
the
charming
and
handsome
prince
hans
santino
fontana
of
the
southern
isles
though
angered
at
first
by
the
clumsiness
of
the
stranger
anna
is
attracted
by
hans's
appearance
and
looks
once
she
lays
his
eyes
on
him
the
coronation
goes
off
without
a
hitch
despite
elsa's
fears
and
she
even
takes
time
to
connect
with
her
sister
at
the
party
anna's
interaction
with
her
sister
brings
quite
the
delightful
feeling
to
the
princess
flustered
at
first
as
well
as
seeing
elsa
so
happy
instead
of
serious
and
preserved
boosts
anna's
confidence
prompting
her
to
continue
on
with
the
conversation
they're
interrupted
afterwards
by
their
steward
kai
introducing
the
snide
duke
of
weselton
who
offers
elsa
her
first
dance
as
queen
elsa
politely
declines
the
offer
but
instead
playfully
volunteers
anna
much
to
the
duke's
delight
nonetheless
and
the
two
head
off
into
a
comical
dance
scene
elsa
couldn't
hold
back
a
chuckle
in
during
which
she
sees
anna
innocently
flustered
by
the
duke's
over
the
top
dancing
skills
this
causes
anna
to
feel
just
as
whimsical
about
the
entire
matter
for
seeing
elsa
in
such
a
state
hasn't
been
a
sight
for
years
anna
returns
by
elsa's
side
afterwards
commenting
on
how
well
things
have
been
going
through
the
day
and
expresses
her
wishes
to
have
things
the
way
they
were
that
night
all
the
time
elsa's
smile
unfortunately
fades
away
and
she
reluctantly
denies
anna's
wishes
all
at
once
though
fails
to
explain
why
so
anna
and
hans
then
sneak
off
to
spend
the
evening
together
quickly
realizing
the
mutual
attraction
between
them
the
romantic
dance
eventually
leads
to
an
entire
date
love
is
an
open
door
with
the
entire
night
of
the
young
couple
being
spent
bonding
hans
during
their
time
together
learns
of
anna's
longing
of
having
someone
special
in
her
life
with
her
sister
apparently
developing
a
dislike
of
being
around
her
by
suddenly
shutting
anna
out
one
day
when
they
were
kids
hans
openly
relates
to
this
only
furthering
anna's
connection
with
him
hans
then
promises
to
never
shut
anna
out
unlike
elsa
much
to
the
princess'
absolute
joy
by
the
end
of
their
tour
throughout
the
kingdom
hans
proposes
right
on
the
spot
to
which
anna
immediately
accepts
the
two
head
back
the
ballroom
where
anna
asks
for
elsa's
blessing
on
the
marriage
elsa's
baffled
by
the
shocking
news
but
anna
and
hans
couldn't
appear
more
excited
going
on
to
ramble
about
the
wedding
arrangements
elsa
ceases
the
sudden
rambling
by
denying
the
marriage
much
to
anna's
heartbreak
the
queen
asks
to
speak
to
anna
alone
in
private
likely
to
finally
confess
her
abilities
and
why
it's
not
wise
to
marry
a
total
stranger
without
causing
a
scene
that
would
surely
get
her
true
magical
nature
exposed
but
the
younger
princess
refuses
any
private
conversation
stating
whatever
elsa
has
to
say
can
be
said
to
both
her
and
hans
elsa
becoming
frustrated
outright
forbids
anna
of
marrying
someone
she
just
met
indirectly
telling
the
princess
she
knows
nothing
about
true
love
this
causes
anna
to
hiss
back
telling
elsa
all
she
knows
is
how
to
shut
people
out
although
elsa
is
visibly
hurt
by
this
she
continues
to
refuse
with
the
argument
only
worsening
when
she
orders
the
guards
to
end
the
party
and
close
the
gates
elsa
refuses
to
grant
her
blessing
on
the
marriage
setting
off
an
argument
between
the
sisters
and
culminating
in
elsa's
abilities
being
exposed
to
the
party
guests
panicking
elsa
flees
with
anna
in
hot
pursuit
as
she
becomes
more
stressed
and
panicked
the
weather
starts
turning
colder
snow
begins
to
fall
and
elsa
races
across
the
fjord
freezing
it
with
each
step
but
turning
the
whole
body
of
water
into
ice
and
trapping
all
the
ships
before
spreading
throughout
the
rest
of
the
kingdom
having
fail
to
retrieve
her
anna
and
hans
return
to
the
castle
courtyard
where
the
guests
have
gathered
the
duke
of
weselton
begins
to
panic
as
it
eerily
begins
snowing
declaring
they
must
take
action
and
put
an
end
to
elsa's
curse
anna
however
refuses
and
volunteers
to
seek
out
elsa
herself
and
make
things
right
feeling
that
it's
her
fault
for
pushing
her
with
hans
being
left
in
charge
of
the
kingdom
anna
heads
off
on
her
horse
to
begin
her
search
for
her
sister
elsa
makes
it
to
the
north
mountain
where
she
laments
her
failure
at
keeping
the
powers
contained
but
quickly
becomes
more
and
more
at
ease
and
relaxed
free
to
use
her
powers
as
she
pleases
singing
the
song
let
it
go
creating
a
snowman
the
same
one
she
and
anna
built
when
they
were
young
an
ice
castle
and
ice
dress
while
searching
for
elsa
anna
loses
her
horse
in
the
process
she
travels
on
foot
until
nightfall
where
she
finds
herself
at
wandering
oaken's
trading
post
and
sauna
she
asks
the
shop
owner
oaken
chris
williams
for
winter
boots
and
dresses

makes
small
talk
with
him
then
meets
kristoff
jonathan

convinces
kristoff
to
take
her
to
the
north
mountain
where
the
source
of
the
winter
is
coming
from

get
attacked
by

on
their
journey

promising
to

by
her
sister
and
help
her

only
grows
more
agitated
and
nervous
resulting
in

strikes

in
the
heart

desperation
to

a
giant

calls
marshmallow
to
throw
them
out
as
revenge
anna
balls
up
a
snowball
and
throws
it
at
the
giant
beast
though
it
left
literally
no
damage
whatsoever
the
lack
of
respect
was
enough
to
infuriate
marshmallow
and
cause
him
to
chase
anna
kristoff
and
olaf
down
the
northern
mountain
and
most
likely
eliminate
them
marshmallow
manages
to
corner
them
at
the
edge
of
a
cliff
though
kristoff
immediately
begins
digging
a
snow
anchor
by
using

however
catches
up

stop
him

over
the
cliff
and
continues
his
chase
for
anna
and
kristoff
he
pulls
them
up
to
his
face
by
the
rope
and
orders
them
once
more
to
never
return
just
after
anna
grabs
kristoff's
knife
and
cuts
the
rope
this
sends
the
duo
plummeting
down

they
survive

his
mission

hold
most
of
the
guards
off

however
proves
to
be
a
fierce
warrior
himself
avoiding

plummets
down
into
the
chasm
below
apparently
to
his
death
while
hans
battles
marshmallow
the
duke's
men
attack
elsa
she
fights
back
nearly
killing
them
both
much
to
her
own
horror
just
as
elsa
was
about
to
murder
the
two
hans
appears
and
stops
her
to
say
not
to
prove
she's
the
monster
they
believe
she
is
elsa
settles
down
a
bit
at
hans'
words
realizing
the
demon
she
was
becoming
and
halts
her
magic
one
of
the
soldiers
however
aims
his
arrow
at
elsa
still
following
the
duke's
orders
hans
intervenes
just
as
the
soldier
is
about
to
shoot
her
causing
the
arrow
to
cut
through
elsa's
chandelier
which
then
plummets
towards
the
ground
elsa
tries
to
escape
the
collision
but
is
knocked
out
in
the
process
hans
and
the
soldiers
then
capture
her
and
head
back
to
the
kingdom
she
wakes
up
shackled
in
a
cell
back
in
arendelle
castle
hans
pleads
with
her
to
undo
the
winter
but
elsa
replies
that
she
can't
due
to
the
fact
that
she
is
unable
to
control
her
powers
anna
is
returned
to
hans
freezing
more
and
more
cold
and
sick
by
the
minute
she
tells
hans
everything
that
has
happened
and
hopes
he
will
kiss
her
and
break
the
curse
but
he
instead
cruelly
reveals
that
he
had
been
pretending
to
love
her
the
whole
time
as
part
of
a
fiendish
plan
to
seize
control
of
arendelle's
throne
because
he
is
the
youngest
of
thirteen
brothers
and
will
never
reach
the
throne
in
his
own
kingdom
anna
tries
to
stop
him
but
she
is
far
too
weak
he
puts
the
fire
out
to
prevent
anna
from
getting
any
heat
and
warmth
and
leaves
anna
to
freeze
to
death
then
he
tells
the
duke
and
the
kingdom's
officials
what
anna
told
him
in
addition
of
lying
that
he
was
too
late
to
save
her
he
also
pretends
to
grieve
for
her
and
sentences
elsa
to
death
as
part
of
his
plan
elsa
escapes
from
prison
when
she
learns
hans'
means
to
have
her
executed
for
treason
and
heads
out
into
the
blizzard
on
the
fjord
meanwhile
anna's
curse
becomes
stronger
with
her
death
process
nearly
complete
when
olaf
arrives
he
finds
anna
in
the
library
on
the
ground
and
quickly
dying
olaf
comes
to
anna's
rescue
and
starts
a
fire
to
keep
the
princess
warm
olaf
then
asks
what
happened
with
the
true
love's
kiss
from
hans
to
which
anna
reveals
his
treachery
and
hans
never
loved
her
fearing
he'll
melt
anna
tells
olaf
to
leave
not
wanting
to
abandon
his
friend
the
snowman
stays
by
her
side
and
nearly
melts
during
this
time
anna
brokenheartedly
tells
olaf
that
she
doesn't
even
know
what
love
is
anymore
olaf
replies
by
telling
anna
that
love
is
putting
someone
else
before
yourself
using
kristoff
as
an
example
this
reveals
kristoff's
true
feelings
to
anna
much
to
the
princess'
surprise
suddenly
the
library's
window
bursts
open
due
to
the
strong
winter
winds
olaf
rushes
to
close
it
but
he
then
notices
kristoff
and
sven
rushing
back
to
the
castle
knowing
kristoff
is
truly
the
one
that
loves
anna
the
two
try
to
head
out
to
meet
him
olaf
then
aids
the
dying
princess
out
of
the
castle
and
into
the
fjords
the
two
then
travel
together
out
on
the
fjord
to
find
him
where
he
is
racing
back
to
the
kingdom
with
a
sword
at
hand
hans
is
prepared
to
slay
the
queen
hans
eventually
stumbles
upon
her
telling
her
that
she
can't
escape
all
the
horrible
things
she's
already
done
elsa
pleads
for
mercy
still
believing
hans
to
be
a
benevolent
prince
and
asks
him
to
take
care
of
her
sister
for
her
hans
cuts
elsa
off
and
tells
her
that
anna
is
dead
because
of
her
devastated
by
the
horrific
news
elsa
breaks
down
in
tears
in
elsa's
despair
the
storm
immediately
stops
this
then
gives
kristoff
and
anna
the
chance
to
reach
each
other
but
at
that
moment
anna
hears
a
sword
being
drawn
a
short
distance
away
in
horror
anna
sees
that
hans
is
about
to
kill
her
sister
anna
must
choose
to
save
herself
or
her
sister
which
is
only
seconds
away
after
one
last
look
at
kristoff
she
makes
her
decision
to
save
elsa
and
throw
herself
between
elsa
and
hans
she
freezes
solid
just
as
hans'
sword
hits
her
instead
of
elsa
also
causing
hans
to
be
brutally
knocked
out
unconscious
elsa
after
a
few
moments
of
despair
sees
that
her
sister
has
thawed
and
come
back
to
life
because
she
sacrificed
herself
to
save
her
sister
constituting
an
act
of
true
love
which
olaf
first
realizes
elsa
realizes
that
love
is
the
key
to
controlling
her
powers
and
thaws
the
kingdom
olaf
overjoyed
smiles
with
glee
but
quickly
melts
due
to
the
summer
heat
elsa
restores
him
and
gives
him
a
small
flurry
cloud
to
hover
over
his
body
and
keep
him
completely
cool
finally
allowing
the
snowman
to
live
his
dream
of
experiencing
summer
and
all
its
wonders
when
hans
awakens
several
moments
later
he
finds
arendelle
thawed
and
peace
restored
when
kristoff
attempted
to
confront
hans
for
trying
to
kill
the
two
sisters
elsa
seems
touched
by
kristoff's
protectiveness
over
her
and
anna
anna
however
decides
to
confront
him
instead
anna
then
approaches
the
manipulative
prince
which
the
sight
of
anna
alive
and
well
confuses
hans
and
prompts
him
to
ask
how
she'd
survive
the
