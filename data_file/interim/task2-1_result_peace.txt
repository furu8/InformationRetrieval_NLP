10264,Peace psychology,0.4628974999342424,peace psychology is a subfield of psychology and peace research that deals with the psychological aspects of peace conflict violence and war peace psychology can be characterized by four interconnected pillars 1 research 2 education 3 practice and 4 advocacy the first pillar research is documented most extensively in this wiki entry peace psychological activities are based on psychological models theories and methods they are usually normatively bound in their means and objectives by working towards the ideal of sustainable peace using as far as possible nonviolent means violence and peace are usually defined in terms of johan galtungs extended conceptualization of peace according to which peace is not merely the absence of personal direct violence and war  negative peace but also the absence of structural indirect and cultural violence  positive peace the ideal of peace can also be conceptualized as the comprehensive implementation of human rights civil political economic social and cultural rights this should among other purposes ensure the satisfaction of basic human needs such as positive personal and social identity sense of control security social justice wellbeing a safe environment and access to adequate food and shelter organizations that focus on peace psychology include for example in the united states the society for the study of peace conflict and violence peace psychology division 48 of the american psychological association and psychologists for social responsibility a nongovernmental organization based in washington dc germany has the forum friedenspsychologie and the australian psychological society has an interest group called psychologists for peace on the international level there is the committee for the psychological study of peace as well as the international network of psychologists for social responsibility which links organizations from among other countries germany finland the united states australia costa rica india and italy peace psychological research peace psychological research can be analytically research on peace or normatively research for peace oriented regardless of its analytical or normative orientation peace psychological research mainly deals with the psychological aspects of the formation escalation reduction and resolution of conflicts including war the psychosocial conditions conducive or detrimental to a sustainable peace and the psychosocial effects of war and violence in each case different levels of analysis and explanation are relevant from the level of individuals to groups social organizations and institutions states and state systems eg the european union military alliances eg nato and collective security systems eg the united nations and the organization for security and cooperation in europe  formation and escalation of conflict peace psychology focuses on the psychological aspects of the formation escalation reduction and resolution of conflicts a conflict exists when the expectations interests needs or actions of at least two parties to the conflict are perceived by at least one of the parties to be incompatible peace psychology is mainly concerned with conflicts between social groups intergroup conflicts such as between ethnic groups clans religious groups states etc in terms of domains like power wealth access to raw materials and markets cultural or religious values honor dignity or recognition in conflicts one has to distinguish between overt positions eg  we dont negotiate with x and underlying interests eg power spheres of influence and wealth as well as between current triggers eg violence at a political protest and systematic enduring structural causes eg deprivation of a groups political participation or access to professional employment although conflicts are inevitable and can lead to positive change when dealt with constructively the escalation of conflicts and in particular the occurrence of violence are preventable psychological processes of information processing attention perception memory thinking judgment emotion and motivation influence substantially how a conflict is handled and in particular whether conflicts escalate to violent episodes an important factor is the different points of view of the conflict parties such as when behavior that is based on positive intentions is perceived by the opponent as aggressive and therefore contributes to escalation conflicts can easily escalate a cycle of violence can arise in which both parties are involved and original victims can become perpetrators without realizing it victim myth conflicts can be intensified specifically through the construction of enemy images psychological warfare and propaganda promulgated by the media political elite educational systems socialization cultural symbols and other means enemy images may have a kernel of truth but overstate the negative sides of the opponent the core features of a strong enemy image include 1 a negative evaluation of the opponent eg aggressive immoral but also inferior 2 a onesided blame for negative events and 3 a different evaluation of similar actions of ones own side than the enemy double standard eg buildup of arms on one’s own side is selfdefense on the enemys it is aggression these constructions can cause dehumanization of the opponent so that moral standards no longer apply in extreme cases it may seem acceptable even desirable for the opponent to suffer and be killed the construction of the enemy image has the central function of justifying armament violence and war in addition it enhances the individual and collective selfimage psychological warfare includes methods of generating or strengthening war support among the civilian population and the military these methods include disinformation using the media war propaganda but also sabotage displacement murder and terror war propaganda consists of two complementary strategies 1 repeating highlighting and embellishing with detail information that functions to intensify the enemy image or threat perceptions and 2 ignoring and devaluing information that may lead to deescalation in addition negative behavior of the adversary may be provoked eg by maneuvers at the state borders or charges that the enemy engaged in heinous acts may be entirely invented eg the nayirah testimony conflict reduction and resolution peace psychological strategies different peace psychological strategies for nonviolent conflict resolution are discussed conflict deescalation conflict resolution conflict transformation one can distinguish between strategies on the official level eg measures of tension reduction and trust build such as charles e osgoods graduated and reciprocated initiatives in tension reduction  negotiations mediation approaches of unofficial diplomacy interactive problemsolving workshops and strategies at the level of civil society eg peace journalism contact between social groups official level osgoods grit model was designed as a counterconcept to the arms race in the eastwest conflict in which the former superpowers usa and ussr constantly increased the quantity and quality of their arms so that the destruction of humankind by a nuclear war seemed increasingly possible the grit model in contrast aimed to deescalate and create an atmosphere of mutual trust one party publicly announces and performs a verifiable concrete step to reduce tension and asks or invites the other side to do something similar developing a spiral of trust care is taken so that each step does not endanger the safety of ones own side grit was designed to reverse the tension involved in the nuclear arms race by having each side engage in graduated and reciprocal inititiatives while there is no firm evidence it has been suggested that us president kennedy and the soviet leader khrushchev based their negotiations after the cuban missile crisis on this concept when conflicted parties are engaged in longlasting severe conflicts it can be difficult to have constructive bilateral negotiations in this case a third party eg a social scientist or reputed politician can serve as a mediator in order to facilitate conflict management mediators must be well aware of the conflict and its history should have the confidence of both conflict parties and need to be familiar with conflict analysis and communication strategies important strategies include establishing trust working out the essential elements of conflict and possibly dividing the problem so that at least partial solutions can be achieved and violence can be prevented or stopped problems arise when mediators are biased and have strong individual interests mediation success is more likely if the conflict is moderately intense the power difference between the parties is low and the mediators have high prestige as a person or because of organizational affiliation unofficial level in severe longlasting conflicts it may be advisable to intervene at a level below official diplomacy interactive problem solving is such an informal approach to bring members of the conflict parties together these can include citizens who are wellrespected from different areas of society such as media business politics education or religion a team of social scientists eg psychologists initiate and promote a problemsolving process with the elements of conflict diagnosis generation of alternatives and development of nonviolent solutions that results in outcomes that are satisfactory to all parties involved there is the expectation or hope that the participants influence their governments and public opinion so that official negotiations can follow psychologically important components of the process are that the respective self and enemy images are corrected interactive problem solving was used in particular in the israelpalestine conflict by the us psychologist herbert kelman and his team civil society level media are often involved in the formation of enemy images and escalation of conflict peace journalism in contrast has the objective of investigating and using the influence of the media as a means of encouraging the constructive nonviolent resolution of conflict key strategies include representing the conflicting parties as well as the conflict and its history appropriately identifying propaganda and articulating the suffering of the people the collective action and peaceful demonstrations of the population toward peaceful and socially just ends can have an influence on the decisions of those in power – particularly in democracies citizens commitment depends among other factors on the existence of opportunities in society individual value orientations eg valuing nonviolence social justice the presence of role models and the perceived probability of success of ones actions contacts between opposing groups eg on the level of municipalities associations universities trade unions can contribute to building positive relationships and the reduction of prejudice see contact hypothesis conditions associated with the improvement of intergroup relations when groups come in contact with one another include the actors involved have similar social status there are common goals that can be achieved through cooperation and the contacts are supported by authorities in society in asymmetric conflicts where one conflict party is politically economically andor militarily clearly superior the stronger party may not be interested in a truly sustainable conflict resolution under asymmetric conditions when the root causes of the conflict cannot be sufficiently addressed structural violence persists for such situations approaches have been developed such as nonviolent resistance and liberation psychology which originated in latin america and is related to liberation theology nonviolent resistance refers to public nonviolent behavior directed against injustice it involves publically explicating ones own intentions committing to communicate with the other side and the willingness to endure negative consequences of ones own actions methods of nonviolent resistance range from protests eg demonstrations to noncooperation eg strikes boycotts to civil resistance eg traffic blockades particularly well known are the actions speeches and writings of mahatma gandhi and martin luther king effects of war and violence peace psychology examines war and violence between groups also with the aim of illustrating the psychological and social costs of war and violence and to document the human suffering caused the psychological consequences include in particular traumatization mainly of the civilian population but also members of the military cognitive and emotional damage and the destruction of trustful social relationships wars often do not resolve the underlying problems they often provoke new violence and wars for example in postwar societies an increased level of family and community violence can be observed in addition resources necessary to deal with civilian issues eg education health social welfare are lost there is still little comprehensive and objective research on the consequences and costs of war psychosocial conditions of sustainable peace even when violence has been stopped or a peace treaty reached to prevent the risk of a renewed escalation physical and economic reconstruction as well as sociopolitical and psychosocial interventions are required these interventions aim to cure psychosocial wounds of war build trust develop a common collective memory recognize past wrongdoing and achieve reconciliation andor forgiveness examples are trauma therapy and truth and reconciliation commissions also irrespective of any specific conflict and violence peace psychological research looks at the psychosocial conditions that hamper or promote sustainable peace the basic aim is to transform cultures of violence into cultures of peace the following cultural characteristics are obstacles to the development of sustainable peace the view of ones own group ethnicity religion nation etc to be superior and more valuable and others as inferior and of little value or in the extreme case no value the development of enemy images dehumanization of others legitimization of violence and damage underlying beliefs ideologies such as ethnocentrism social dominance orientation authoritarianism nationalism militarism and an education system that promotes these ideologies power differentials that are defended or increased by the powerful and that create unequal conditions in areas such as wealth health education and political participation structural violence among factors conducive to the development of sustainable peace are the fundamental belief that conflicts are frequent but that they can be solved without violence and for the benefit of the various conflict parties the concept of humanism with the features of human dignity pacifism empathy respect tolerance and solidarity and respect for all people or for humanity as a whole critical proximity to ones own group that – in addition to positive identification – also integrates own weaknesses mistakes and committed wrongdoings in the collective selfconcept in the transformation of cultures of violence into cultures of peace the focus on human rights is of high importance human rights are inalienable rights that apply to all human beings without distinction as to sex color ethnicity language religion political opinion or social origin prohibition of discrimination the un human rights charter contains the essential documents of the universal declaration of human rights udhr 1948 and the twin covenants 1966 international covenant on economic social and cultural rights and international covenant on civil and political rights the udhr consists of 30 articles with more than 100 individual rights including civil and political rights eg right to life prohibition of torture right to fair and public trial right to asylum freedom of speech regular elections but also social economic and cultural rights including the right to work rest holidays with pay protection from unemployment the right to food clothing housing medical care and free primary education of particular importance in the uns human rights concept is that all human rights are significant indivisibility and that they apply to all people universality psychological research on human rights has mainly examined knowledge attitudes and readiness to act in support of human rights representative surveys in germany show that the realization of human rights is considered to be very important but at the same time knowledge of human rights is low and inaccurate the results show a halving of human rights some civil rights are known while economic and social rights are hardly considered human rights of importance in peace psychology are also analyses of whether human rights are used in the sense of peace or whether they are abused for the construction of enemy images or to prepare wars peace psychology in education peace psychological findings are used in the content and practice of peace education at various levels from primary school to secondary and tertiary education eg in the form of peace psychology courses at universities to vocational training the conflict information consortium at the university of colorado offers the beyond intractability project an openly accessible cooperative learning platform peace psychological practice peace psychology practice refers for example to trauma therapeutic work the implementation of trainings in nonviolent conflict resolution and activities in such roles as conflict mediator or civil peace worker of particular importance is the cooperation between research and practice such as in the form of evaluation research to contribute to the continuous improvement of practice peace psychological advocacy advocacyoriented peace psychologists sometimes as part of the peace movement try to influence policymakers and society more generally in terms of peace psychologys normative orientation toward the ideal of peace this can take various forms for example participating in peace activities eg demonstrations releasing political statements or giving expert evidence in the policy development process

them says tschetter wow what a country over the years the tschetters have returned to india five times to visit their friends once as a peace corps volunteer tschetter traveled across india to deliver medicine to a village suffering from a smallpox epidemic ultimately the village recovered said tschetter and today smallpox is eradicated in the world and it is because of this and thousands of other experiences like it career as investment executive tschetter began his career in 1970 as both a retail and institutional investment executive with blyth eastman dillon union securities he joined dain rauscher in 1973 as a broker and spent 28 years there primarily in management before he retired in 2004 tschetter was named president of da davidson  co a fullservice investment firm based in the northwest tschetter served on the securities industry association sales and marketing committee and the new york stock exchange regional firms advisory committee peace corps director the white house announced tschetters nomination on july 25 2006 and tschetter was confirmed as director of the peace corps by the us senate on september 13 2006 and was sworn in on september 26 2006 becoming the third returned peace corps volunteer to serve as director and the first under a republican administration tschetter had previously served on the national peace corps association board from 1993 to 1999 as board chairman from 1995 to 1998 and as an honorary board member from 2000 to 2003 in an interview with drew houff of the winchester star in march 2008 tschetter said that representing the peace corps is an honor it’s the best job in washington — i report directly to the president tschetter says it is bipartisan apolitical and supported by most everyone it also is strongly recognized as a great brand i tell the new volunteers ‘you are working for the gold standard of volunteerism in the peace corps’ promoting the peace corps tschetter says that his service as a volunteer was a life changing experience and for the past 40 years he and his wife have worked to convince others to make the same commitment when you do and are going through it you just don’t realize how much it is going to impact your life says tschetter your whole value system your insight perceptions are impacted as such that it really changes your outlook it changes what you do and it changes your desire to serve tschetter says that he almost always accepts invitations to talk about the peace corps especially at universities because it helps bring new volunteers into the program and helps people understand what the peace corps does when i get an invitation from a university it gets my attention because i just know what this can do for a young person who decides to do it tschetter says i am here to encourage the students that this is an option in your life that you ought to give serious consideration recruitment of older volunteers during his confirmation hearings tschetter announced that he would make recruiting older volunteers a priority for the peace corps i hope to examine the agency’s recruiting process in order to broaden the applicant pool and better tap into the baby boom generation a rich harvestable field of potential volunteers in april 2007 the peace corps announced the new 50 plus initiative under the initiative older volunteers will be placed in nine test countries cameroon lesotho and south africa along with ukraine romania thailand jamaica dominican republic and panama as part of the program peace corps recruiting messages will be focused on adults 50 and older and publicized through groups such as the aarp and the national retired teachers association older volunteers must successfully complete the medical clearing process to serve overseas we cant compromise when we send people abroad there is no fancy hospital around the corner says tschetter medical screening traditionally a lengthy and onerous process for older applicants will be streamlined and the transition time from acceptance to placement may be lengthened so older volunteers have more time to deal with personal affairs  the peace corps announced a goal to boost the ranks of volunteers 50 and older from 5 percent of the 7749 americans in the peace corps to 15 percent over the next two years theres around 80 million baby boomers that are now starting to retire theyre healthy and they have a real service element to them said tschetter during a trip to montana in may 2008 they love to give of themselves in a variety of service ways including volunteerism the peace corps reported in august 2008 that applications from seniors had risen 50 since the campaign began in september 2007 the new campaign  called still asking what you can do for your country is designed to appeal to baby boomers who grew up in the kennedy years jfk was a role model for everyone i knew back in the early 60s said loyci stockey 64 who is beginning his service as a peace corps volunteer in uganda hed spoken passionately during my high school graduation year about some new program he was starting called the peace corps i never forgot his message and i tucked it away in the back of my head to act on someday today is my someday murder of peace corps volunteer in the philippines after the disappearance of peace corps volunteer julia campbell in the philippines in april 2007 tschetter

campbell case i cannot express enough my appreciation to the philippine government for the way they handled the situation how quickly they found the body said tschetter the incident has not affected our opinion and our presence in the philippines we dont see any situation at the present time that could threaten our presence in the philippines actions by us ambassador to tanzania michael retzer on june 14 2007 the peace corps issued a press release announcing its strong disagreement with the decision of michael retzer us ambassador to tanzania to withdraw the authorization for peace corps country director christine djondo to remain in tanzania the peace corps has always had full confidence in ms djondo as country director unfortunately us ambassador michael retzer did not concur and has exercised his authority as chief of mission to withdraw the authorization for ms djondo to remain in country the press release added that the adverse effects of retzers decision on the peace corps program in tanzania included affecting the morale of volunteers new trainees and staff and that because of the number of staff transitions in tanzania the june training class is being reduced by half to ensure adequate support for currently serving volunteers and the new training class  on june 27 senator chris dodd put a hold on the nomination of mark green to replace retzer as ambassador citing retzers action as interference in the independence of the peace corps dodd asked that retzer rescind his cable of no confidence of djondo or that the state department provide a written apology to her on june 28 the state department provided a written letter of apology to djondo and senator dodd released his hold on greens nomination allowing it to go forward embassy incident in bolivia in july 2007 just before a new group of thirty peace corps volunteers were sworn in they received a security briefing from us embassy security officer vincent cooper in which they were asked to basically spy on cubans and venezuelans in the country according to a report from abc news on february 8 2008 peace corps deputy director for bolivia doreen salazar was present at the meeting and found the comments so out of line that she interrupted the briefing to clarify that volunteers did not have to follow the embassys instructions and salazar protested directly to the embassy we made it clear to the embassy that this was an inappropriate request and they agreed associated press reported that the us embassy in la paz had issued a statement saying that some routine information sessions about security given to certain american citizens included incorrect information as soon as this was brought to our attention appropriate measures were taken to assure that these errors would not be repeated there is no indication that any peace corps volunteer made reports to the embassy and peace corps issued a press release reiterating in no uncertain terms that the corps is not involved in any intelligence gathering on february 11 2008 the associated press reported that bolivian president evo morales had declared cooper an undesirable person the us embassy released a statement explaining that volunteers had mistakenly been given a security briefing meant only for embassy staff nobody at the embassy has ever asked american citizens to participate in intelligence activities here said us ambassador phillip s goldberg but i want to say that i greatly regret the incident that was made known this weekend budget shortfall at peace corps on july 23 2008 the minneapolis star tribune reported that peace corps would be closing their minneapolis and denver recruitment offices at the end of the year tschetter said in a letter to minnesota congresswoman betty mccollum that peace corps is facing an estimated 87 million shortfall in its budget for fy2008 because of the weakening dollar and that the tight budget could force the peace corps to reduce the number of volunteers serving worldwide by 5 or 400 volunteers withdrawal of volunteers from bolivia on september 16 2008 peace corps announced it was suspending operations in bolivia due to growing instability and withdrawing all volunteers from the country our first priority is the safety and security of our volunteers said tschetter the withdrawal came in the aftermath of growing unrest in bolivia after more than 30 people were killed in pando the previous week and the expulsion of us ambassador philip goldberg after accusations by the bolivian government accusing the american government of inciting the violence state department press secretary sean mccormack was asked during a press conference on september 16 if the withdrawal of peace corps volunteers has anything to do with any reduction measure and he replied that we have to look at the situation on the ground and it’s our obligation to take those steps that we think are necessary to ensure that our people are able to accomplish the longterm goals of that mission and we believe that this was a prudent step based on the situation on the ground in bolivia referring to the decision to withdraw volunteers mccormack added that security played a big part in it  mac maroglis wrote in newsweek on september 20 that after bolivia expelled us ambassador goldberg that washington answered by sending off the bolivian and venezuelan ambassadors and even suspending peace corps operations the peace corps issued a press release on september 22 that while the expulsion of the us ambassador was considered by the peace corps the decision to temporarily suspend the peace corps program in bolivia was based on the peace corps emergency action plan and its evaluation process for suspensions and evacuations the safety and security of the volunteers and their ability to do their work are the primary factors in such a decision in the case of bolivia there was increasing civil unrest including blockading of major transportation routes a mass protest and march planned and escalating violence against bolivian citizens we made the decision to consolidate the volunteers and then to move all 113 volunteers based on our own evaluation  on october 22 2008 associated press published a story saying that several volunteers who had been serving in bolivia believe that the us government overreacted with a blanket withdrawal of volunteers and that although some parts of bolivia were unstable most volunteers felt no security threat peace corps unfortunately has become another weapon in the us diplomatic arsenal said sarah nourse who had been serving as a volunteer in bolivia thomas shannon the top us diplomat for latin america said that security had been the only reason for the pullout of peace corps volunteers we dont politicize the peace corps shannon said joshua partlow reported in the washington post on october 23 2008 that when peace corps volunteers were being evacuated from bolivia volunteers were asked how many planned to return to bolivia on their own and about half the group members raised their hands according to participants the article stated that more than 15 volunteers have since returned to bolivia after leaving the peace corps and are working on their own to complete the projects they began as peace corps volunteers ive never felt safer in my life than i was here said volunteer aaron york i needed to be back here    there was no time to say goodbye to everyone to achieve any kind of closure in my service in my life here and i really felt like i needed that a spokesman for the peace corps said that the peace corps does not anticipate being able to return volunteers to bolivia and reopen the program until fall of 2009 at the earliest liberia program reopened after 18 years on october 22 2008 the voice of america reported that peace corps is reopening its program in liberia which closed in 1990 due to the liberian civil war with the country enjoying a new period of peace and at the request of president sirleaf the peace corps is reestablishing a program to help rebuild liberias education infrastructure and it was last year in october that the president of the united states told president sirleaf that we would work to make that happen said state department press secretary dana perino the original program in liberia ran from 1961 to 1990 and over 4400 volunteers served in liberia during that period liberian president ellen johnson sirleaf had requested that the peace corps reestablish its program peace corps volunteers will work in teacher training programs libraries high schools parentteacher associations and health care proposal for peace corps foundation on october 23 2008 tschetter proposed the creation of a peace corps foundation as a private charitable nonprofit corporation to advance the peace corps third goal of inspiring a better understanding of other cultures through returned volunteers in america and to increase public awareness within the united states of peace corps volunteer experiences and the diversity of the countries in which they serve tschetter proposed that the foundation not be a federal agency but that funding would be sought from corporations foundations and private individuals while grants would be provided for programs approved by a governing board tschetter proposed that the foundation have a building in washington dc that would serve as an education facility where americans particularly children would come and learn more about other cultures and countries as well as how the peace corps fulfills its mission of promoting peace and friendship worldwide

provoking criticism from the church in canada this led to his resignation from the ministry and the mission on may 5 1946 after the united church of canada gave him an ultimatum to either modify his public statements or quit at zhou enlais urging he moved to shanghai to publish the underground antikuomintang shanghai newsletter the newsletter was aimed at westerners in the kuomintang stronghold as well as at trying to convince western governments that chiangs regime was corrupt and dictatorial return to canada in 1947 he returned to canada at a time when western countries were backing chiang and were optimistic about his government endicott advised the canadian government that the kuomintang regimes fall was imminent and then went public with his predictions and his denunciation of the kuomintang as corrupt his comments were denounced as traitorous by the media and he was labelled the most reviled canadian of the year for his support of the chinese revolution and the communist party of china and was criticized by the united church for his support of the revolution he continued his support for the chinese communist party by giving lectures and publishing the canadian far eastern weekly which had 5000 subscribers at its peak canadian peace congress in 1949 he founded and became chairman of the canadian peace congress and helped publish its peace letter bulletin he also became a senior figure in the world peace council serving as president of the international institute for peace from 1957 until 1971  in 1950 as a canadian delegate to the world peace council in stockholm endicott sat on the committee that drafted the stockholm peace appeal which was the petition that began the international ban the bomb movement korean war endicott returned on a visit to china in 1952 during the korean war and on his return to canada charged the united states with using chemical and biological weapons during the war his charges led him to be vilified in the canadian press as public enemy number one and he was censured by the united church for his support of mao zedong and the chinese communists  he was condemned by canadian politicians including lester pearson who had been a college friend pearson called him the bait on the end of a red hook and a red stooge while john george diefenbaker called his statements damnable and conservative leader george drew referred to endicott as a jackal of the communists  the government threatened to charge him with treason and sedition but did not follow through while others called for him to lose his passport and mailing privileges later work endicott was awarded the stalin peace prize in 1952 for his efforts working for peaceful coexistence between the christians and the communists he continued his advocacy for the peoples republic of china by publishing the canadian far east newsletter and though he publicly backed the soviet union in the initial years of the sinosoviet split he was sympathetic to chinas arguments and reported them in the newsletter endicott was offered the presidency of the world peace council in the early 1960s but declined due to his wifes declining health and what he anticipated as a personally untenable position of leading the council during a period of growing tensions between the soviet union and the peoples republic of china and their respective factions on the council  in 1982 the united church extended a formal apology to endicott for having denounced him three decades earlier acknowledging that it had caused him much personal hurt and anxiety tiananmen square and later views on china in an interview shortly before his death endicott said that he thought the communist manifesto is still as true as ever though he feels the old men who are communist leaders like deng xiaoping are not progressive enough  though ambivalent about the policies of deng and initially sympathetic to the tiananmen square protests of 1989 endicott believed the chinese governments version of events he told an interviewer what is more clear to me now is that there was a core of students who were concerned mainly with getting something done about corruption in the party and in the society i said at the time they should be supported but a lot of the leaders who at the time appeared to be idealistic turned out to be agents for a capitalist restoration it appears now that the communist government was relatively correct in saying that very few people were killed in tiananmen  perhaps two or three hundred at most but in another western section of beijing a lot of people were killed there was practically a shootout between the capitalist roaders and the socialists  if you can call the army socialists arguing that there was an attempt to overthrow the chinese government endicott stated what took place was a minor civil war the armys action in upholding the constitution probably prevented the capitalist roaders from really making an attempt to take over by military force what was the government to do not react relationship with canadian communists in 1971 william kashtan general secretary of the communist party of canada asked him to resign from the canadian peace congress and as canadas delegate to the world council of peace accusing the canadian far east newsletter of being antisoviet and promao endicott agreed to leave the organization rather than stop publication of the newsletter or withdraw his support for china in its conflict with the soviet union he founded the canadachina society shortly after leaving the canadian peace congress and publicly broke with the soviet union  though friendly with tim buck stanley ryerson leslie morris and other canadian communists endicott never joined the communist party of canada though three of his children joined its predecessor the labourprogressive party he had joined the cooperative commonwealth federation while living in toronto on sabbatical from 1941 to 1944 and campaigned for the party in the 1942 federal byelection in which joseph noseworthy won an upset victory but his membership lapsed when he returned to china when he applied to rejoin the ccf in 1948 his membership application was rejected though no reason was given it is almost certain it was rejected due to the perception that endicotts association with communism

3649,Fort Frances Pulp and Paper v Manitoba Free Press,0.11577904383393843,fort frances pulp and paper v manitoba free press is a famous canadian constitutional decision of the judicial committee of the privy council on the emergency doctrine of the peace order and good government power in the british north america act 1867 background during the first world war through orders in council under the war measures act the federal government of canada maintained strict control on the supply and price of goods after the war ended these controls were continued in certain key sectors including newsprint under an order in council made on 20 december 1919 controls on the supply and price of paper had been vested in the paper control tribunal under an order in council made on 16 september 1918 and the parliament of canada subsequently passed an act in 1919 to place the tribunal on a statutory footing in order for it to complete its work on all outstanding issues arising prior to the declaration of peace the manitoba free press a winnipeg newspaper publisher purchased paper from fort frances pulp and paper orders made by the paper control tribunal on 8 july 1920 provided for a reduction of the price that had been paid representing margins in excess of the regulated price the manitoba free press brought an action against fort frances in the supreme court of ontario to recover the specified amount fort frances counterclaimed for an amount equal to the market price of the paper less sums already paid the courts below at the trial division riddell j gave judgment for the plaintiffs holding that the orders of the tribunal were valid the counterclaim was consequentially dismissed he also noted that all the powers of the minister controller and tribunal were intra vires and valid even in a state of profound peace the trial judges ruling was upheld on appeal to the appellate division although they considered that the question was one of contract as fort frances had issued invoices at the specified prices and the free press had paid them on the basis that the prices were provisional and subject to orders to be made by the paper control tribunal as a result it was not necessary to question the validity of those orders fort frances appealed the ruling to the privy council at the privy council the judgment was upheld although the board said they preferred the trial judges reasoning to that of the appeal court however they did not necessarily agree with riddell js view as to how far the federal power could extend viscount haldane held that it was not in the boards power to determine if there was a national emergency it is entirely in the authority of parliament to determine its existence relying on its recent ruling in the board of commerce case he stated that an emergency is determined by common sense thus world war i was clearly a national emergency and was sufficient reason to invoke the emergency doctrine nonetheless any use of the emergency power must be temporary however it was for the federal government to decide when the state of emergency was over and as such in that regard the board agreed with a recent ruling of the supreme court of the united states on the question which is notable as being the first of only two times that the board cited the decisions of that court impact this decision like many others of its time completely ignored the national concern doctrine established earlier in russell v the queen but it was significant in explaining how far the emergency doctrine could extend in times of emergency effectively incorporating the principle of salus populi est suprema lex as haldane noted therefore in time of an emergency provincial powers can be overridden for the peace order and good government of canada as a whole in addition the discretion given to the parliament of canada as to how long an emergency continues was exercised again in the period following the second world war
