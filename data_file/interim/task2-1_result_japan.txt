taisei brought sa to an end with their last show in nagoya breaking the attendance record for the venue in tokyo taisei formed a band called bad messiah which released four albums and 10 singles from epic sony before dissolving in 1996 sa was reunited in 1999 and in 2000 released the album you must stand up my comrades consisting of remastered versions of the tracks on i get position and newly recorded songs at the reunited sas first show taisei met guitarist naoki from cobra which was appearing as a guest when eventually asked by taisei to join sa naoki agreed on the condition that the

opened for them during their revoltn roll tour of february 2010 sas music though clearly rooted in oi and late70searly80s punk rock is characterized by oftenbreakneck tempos that are often fast enough to be considered hardcore as well as a musical adventurousness that is rather unusual for the genre abrupt timing changes are quite frequent several of their songs have utilized instruments such as horns accordions and banjos and they have even recorded a few ballads as is typical for japanese rock artists outside of the pop genre sas songs typically mix both japanese and englishlanguage lyrics often with partly japanese verses and primarily or entirely english choruses the artwork of the bands releases is notable both for its garishness and for its frequent use of fascistic imagery—particularly on the cover of matchless attack which appears to depict a nurembergstyle rally with the four members of the band as its focal point the bands logo is quite similar though not identical to the official logo of nazi germanys sturmabteilung commonly abbreviated to sa the paramilitary organization that helped to put hitlers third reich into power and that was later purged by hitler in the night of the long knives in the faq section of the bands former official website taisei stated that when he came up with the name sa he did not intend for it to stand for anything in particular and that he was not aware of the association between the name and nazi germany however a fascistic outlook is not at all evident in the lyrics of sa these are characterized by a proaction prounity positivist outlook not unlike that espoused by american hardcore bands such as minor threat or 7 seconds heres an example from dont deny give it a try  discography albums you must stand up my

9087,Gypsy Fly,0.21890125068698613,charles elmer cowman march 13 1868–september 25 1924 was a missionary evangelist in japan he was also one of the cofounders of the oriental missionary society now one mission society formerly oms international early life charles cowman was born on march 13 1868 in toulon illinois to david and mary cowman he grew up in the methodist episcopal church at age 15 he was offered and accepted a summer job as a telegraph operator at a local railway station excelling at this new job he chose not to return to school the following fall and continued with his new profession he received a number of promotions over the following years at 18 he was transferred to a station in chicago and by the time he was 19 he earned a salary comparable to employees who had been working there for many years on june 8 1889 at 21 years old he married childhood friend lettie burd during their first year of marriage they moved to the rocky mountains in order to escape city life when the high altitude caused lettie to become very sick though they returned to chicago for the next 10 years telegraphers’ mission band upon their return to chicago charles continued his work at the telegraph office his attitude had changed though since the last time he was there after a strong conviction charles recommitted his life to god “he made it the first thing in his life to be a christian feeling he must concentrate all his energy upon it page 19 one way in which he did this was by forming the “telegraphers’ mission band in chicago with coworkers who had become christians because of him one member was ernest a kilbourne who would later become a cofounder of the oriental missionary society the telegraphers’ mission band sent letters explaining the gospel to telegraphers all over the united states great britain and australia the oriental missionary society in the late 1890s cowman met and befriended juji nakada at his church grace methodist episcopal church nakada had come from japan to study at moody’s bible institute he too would later become a cofounder of the oriental missionary society upon nakada’s return to japan the telegraphers’ mission band began financially supporting him as a missionary thus continuing the connection they had made with him while he was in the states  after feeling a deep call on their hearts charles and lettie left america on february 1 1901 to serve as missionaries in japan they worked alongside nakada with the dream of starting a bible training institute “the aim of the institute would not be to produce classical scholars but young men and women who could handle their mother tongue with effect who were steeped in the bible and who could so proclaim it as to arrest and influence all classes of people page 52 within a few months of being in japan that dream became a reality when they were able to open a mission hall where nakada could preach the gospel message and train leaders the hall held bible classes in the daytime and was the venue for evangelistic services in the evening this was the beginning of the oriental missionary society in 1902 ernest kilbourne joined cowman and nakada to assist in their growing ministry electric messages a small monthly periodical called electric messages began being printed in november 1902 this was mailed to supporters in the united states and included monthly reports of the work that was being accomplished the name was later changed to the oms standard and is currently called oms outreach tokyo bible training institute having outgrown their original building a need for a larger building for the bible training institute arose in early 1903 by the end of 1903 a new school had opened in tokyo providing ample room to grow the larger space not only accommodated more students but also provided for great conventions and hundreds of guests seoul bible training institute in 1904 three koreans went to japan to attend the tokyo bible training institute through these students oms began to make connections with korea by 1910 they were able to send two missionaries from england john and emily thomas to korea shortly after their arrival another bible training institute opened just outside of seoul similar to japan’s school the seoul bible training institute fostered much growth and transformation of the surrounding region the great village campaign burdened by the number of people who remained unreached in japan cowman began the great village campaign in 1913 he had a vision “whereby every person in japan might hear the gospel in the next five years 125 he could not rest until the entirety of japan’s 58 millionperson population was reached teams of missionaries visited every town village and home throughout japan proclaiming the gospel and distributing bibles tokyo was the first to be visited where 3 million bibles were delivered from there workers went out among the provinces to continue with their goal of providing every home with a bible toward the end of 1914 the hard work began to take a toll on cowman’s health he and lettie returned to america for a short time in 1915 to rest and regain his health the village campaign continued to progress while they were in the states but soon enough they returned to japan to complete the work they had begun 1917 posed to be the most intensive year of the campaign in the spring they went to the large island of kyushu home to 9million residents to establish temporary headquarters as the year went on and the completion of the campaign drew near cowman once again became ill he began to have many heart problems leading lettie and him to leave japan for another few months in january 1918 while at home in america they received news through the oms standard that the japan village campaign was complete about 60 million japanese were equipped with the gospel covering of land page 137 late life while back in america charles regained his health for a short time he traveled for six months telling the incredible story of the great village campaign he would have likely continued traveling the country but numerous heart attacks forced him to rest at his home in california for the next six years he suffered in great pain yet he always kept a positive attitude while continuing his work for the lord “although broken in body he kept an oversight of the home office and every department of work on the field dictating letters by the hundreds page 142 he also began to make plans to go into china so that another bible training institute could be established in march 1924 cowman faithfully signed the bank books of oms over to two trustees ernest kilbourne and wj clark a los angeles businessman death and the cowman memorial bible training institute on the night of july 17 1924 cowman experienced a stroke that paralyzed his entire left side the doctors said he would only live a few more hours but he lived a number of weeks more he passed just after midnight on september 25 1924 page 153 two days after his funeral a letter came to him stating that a fellow worker was giving 25000 to open a bible training institute in china one year later in september 1925 the bible training institute was up and running in shanghai it was fittingly named “the cowman memorial bible training institute page 155 
827,Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907,0.21139740081500397,the was an informal agreement between the united states and the empire of japan whereby the united states of america would not impose restriction on japanese immigration and japan would not allow further emigration to the us the goal was to reduce tensions between the two powerful pacific nations the agreement was never ratified by congress and was ended by the immigration act of 1924 history tensions had been rising in tokyo and san francisco and after the decisive japanese victory against russia japan demanded treatment as an equal the result was a series of six notes communicated between japan and the united states from late 1907 to early 1908 the immediate cause of the agreement was antijapanese nativism in california in 1906 the san francisco california board of education passed a regulation whereby children of japanese descent would be required to attend separate racially specific schools at the time japanese immigrants made up approximately 1 of the population of california many of them had immigrated under the treaty in 1894 which had assured free immigration from japan in the agreement japan agreed not to issue passports for japanese citizens wishing to work in the continental united states thus effectively eliminating new japanese immigration to america in exchange the united states agreed to accept the presence of japanese immigrants already residing in america and to permit the immigration of wives children and parents and to avoid legal discrimination against japanese american children in california schools there was also a strong desire on the part of the japanese government to preserve the image of the japanese people in the eyes of the world japan did not want america to pass any legislation confronting the japanese immigrants in response to what happened to chinese under the chinese exclusion act president theodore roosevelt who had a positive opinion of japan accepted the agreement as proposed by japan as an alternative to more formal restrictive immigration legislation the government of japan continued to issue passports for immigration to the territory of hawaii from where immigrants could move on to the continental united states with few controls history background chinese immigration to california boomed during the gold rush of 1852 but the strict japanese government practiced policies of isolation that thwarted japanese emigration it was not until 1868 that the japanese government lessened restrictions and japanese immigration to the united states began antichinese sentiment motivated american entrepreneurs to recruit japanese laborers in 1885 the first japanese workers arrived in the independent kingdom of hawaii most japanese immigrants wanted to reside in america permanently and came in family groups in contrast to the chinese immigration of young men most of whom soon returned they assimilated to american social norms and clothing styles many joined methodist and presbyterian churches as the japanese population in california grew they were seen with suspicion as an entering wedge by japan by 1905 antijapanese rhetoric filled the pages of the san francisco chronicle in 1905 the japanese and korean exclusion league was established the japanese and korean exclusion league established four policies in 1905 japanese americans did not live in chinatown but throughout the city  segregation of schools at the time there were 93 japanese american students in 23 elementary schools for decades policies existed that segregated japanese schools but they were not enforced as long as there was room and white parents did not complain the japanese and korean exclusion league appeared before the school board multiple times to complain the school board dismissed their claims because it was fiscally infeasible to create new facilities to accommodate only 93 students on april 18 1906 an 85 mw earthquake and the subsequent fires destroyed much of san francisco after the fire the school board sent the 93 japanese american students to the chinese primary school renaming it the oriental public school for chinese japanese and koreans the new policies outraged many parents japanese american parents were angered at the idea that their children were forced to receive an education that was not up to par with that of white children transportation was limited after the earthquake and many students could not attend the oriental public school many japanese americans argued with the school board that the segregation of schools went against the treaty of 1894 the treaty did not expressly address education but did indicate that japanese in america would receive equal rights under thencontrolling decisions of the united states supreme court eg plessy v ferguson 1896 a state did not violate the equal protection clause of the united states constitution by requiring racial segregation so long as the separate facilities were substantially equal japanese americans soon contacted the media in japan to make the government aware of the segregation tokyo newspapers denounced the segregation as an insult to their national pride and honor the japanese government was also highly concerned with their reputation overseas as they wanted to protect their reputation as a world power government officials became aware that a crisis was at hand and intervention was necessary in order to maintain diplomatic peace federal intervention president roosevelt had three objectives to resolve the situation show japan that the policies of california did not reflect the ideals of the entire country force san francisco to remove the segregation policies and reach a resolution to the japanese immigration problem victor metcalf secretary of commerce and labor was sent to investigate the issue and force the rescission of the policies he was unsuccessful local officials wanted japanese exclusion president roosevelt tried to pressure the school board but it would not budge on february 15 1907 the parties came to a compromise if president roosevelt could ensure the suspension of japanese immigration then the school board would allow japanese american students to attend public schools the japanese government did not want to harm their national pride or suffer humiliation like the chinese government in 1882 from the chinese exclusion act the japanese government agreed to stop granting passports to laborers trying to enter the united states unless such laborers were coming to occupy a formerlyacquired home to join a parent spouse or child or to assume active control of a previously acquired farming enterprise concessions were agreed in a note consisting of six points a year later the agreement was followed by the admission of students of japanese ancestry into public schools  the adoption of the 1907 agreement spurred the arrival of picture brides — marriages of convenience made at a distance through photographs by establishing marital bonds at a distance women seeking to emigrate to the united states were able to gain a passport while japanese workers in america were able to gain a helpmate of their own nationality because of this loophole which helped close the gender gap within the community from a ratio of 7 men to every woman in 1910 to less than 2 to 1 by 1920 the japanese american population continued to grow despite the agreements limits on immigration the gentlemens agreement was never written into a law passed by congress but was a formal agreement between america and japan enacted by unilateral action by president roosevelt it was nullified by the immigration act of 1924 which legally banned all asians from migrating to the united states
